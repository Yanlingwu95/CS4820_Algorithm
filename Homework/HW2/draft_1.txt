{\bf Solution:}\\
{\bf Algorithm:}\\
Set the M to empty;\\
Sort the locations of the stranded people in ascending order and save it as L \\
Sort the set of segments of the hotel based on the the endpoints of one hotel in ascending order, and save this set as H\\
for every person p in L: \\
\hspace*{1cm}for every hotel h in H:\\
\hspace*{2cm}If the location of p is in the scale of the h\\
\hspace*{3cm}put the (p,h) into set M;\\
\hspace*{2cm}EndIf\\
\hspace*{1cm}EndFor
\hspace*{1cm}remove p;\\
EndFor\\
If the set H is empty: \\
\hspace*{1cm}It is possible for all people to find accommodation. \\
Else \\
\hspace*{1cm} It is impossible; \\

{\bf Running time} should be $O(n^2)$\\

{\bf Proof} \\
